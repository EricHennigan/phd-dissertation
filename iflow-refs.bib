  review = {:quote: we use faceted values to simultaneously and efficiently simulate
	multiple executions for different security levels, thus providing
	non-interference with minimal overhead, and without the reliance
	on the stuck executions of prior dynamic approaches.
	
	
	:quote: The central insight of this paper is that the correct value
	for y after this assignment depends on the authority of the observer.
	
	
	:quote: non-intereference is a 2-safety property: can only be refuted
	by observing two executions.
	
	
	:cite: no-sensitive-upgrade and permissive-upgrade semantics satisify
	termination-insensitive non-interference.
	
	
	may require up to 2^n processes, one for each principal in the lattice
	
	
	:example:
	
	  if (x)
	
	    y = true
	
	
	Faceted values nest to form trees, I think the nesting implies more
	than just 2^n processes (have a Projection Theorem stating otherwise).
	Also can do compression by arranging tree from root (low) to leaf
	(high).
	
	Control flow splits program evaluation, but only for duration of a
	conditional expression. But what if that split occurs early? Do I
	have to wait for exhaustion of both branches?
	
	
	:example:
	
	  y = true
	
	  z = true
	
	  if (x)
	
	    y = false
	
	  if (y)
	
	    z = false
	
	  return z
	
	
	Naive => fails to ensure TINI, since the output leaks the contents
	of private input
	
	No-Sensitive-Upgrade => guarantees TINI, but at expense of getting
	stuck on some implicit flows
	
	Permissive-Upgrade => still gets stuck, but a bit later than no-sensitive-upgrade
	
	Faceted => correct behavior from perspective of all principals
	
	
	Shows how to perform robust declassification :cite: (check that control
	path to the declassify has not been influenced by attacker, avoids
	confused deputy attack) Puts faceted values even into the DOM, browser
	renders only one facet though.
