Several researchers embrace the addition of security features to existing programming languages as a mechanism to prevent information theft.
Before presenting the detail of implementing an information flow framework, we first review work that has come before to give ourselves an appropriate setting in which to evaluate the contributions of \FlowCore\ and \JitFlow.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

Adding security enhancements for universal programming languages is a task several researchers have embraced.
In this chapter we point out the different approaches for equipping a language with various different information flow systems.

Austin and Flanagan~\cite{1554353,1814220} present a sparse labeling approach for tracking information in dynamic languages.
Our implementation is based on their approach for efficiently tracking information flow in a dynamically-typed language such as JavaScript.
A small benchmark of tests demonstrate a substantial speed-up over universal labeling.

Chandra and Franz~\cite{10.1109/ACSAC.2007.37} present an information flow framework for the Java~VM combining static and dynamic techniques.
A statical analysis is performed which annotates paths of information flow within the resulting bytecode.
These annotations are used at runtime to maintain labels of variables lying in \emph{non}-executed control flow paths.
Unlike other approaches where policies are frozen at compiletime, the policy and enforcement mechanisms are kept separate.
This strategy permits policy changes even during runtime.

Chugh et al.~\cite{1542483} attack the problem of dynamically loaded JavaScript by using staged information flow.
Their approach statically computes an information flow graph for all available code, leaving ``holes'' where code might appear at runtime.
Whenever new code becomes available, it is subjected to the same analysis.
The new subgraph is merged with the current information flow graph and residual checks are performed to ensure that the combined result cannot violate existing policy constraints.

Myers and Liskov~\cite{363526} introduce a new programming language called Jif (Java Information Flow), which extends Java with static checking of information flow.
Though the static analysis techniques developed in this work are not applicable to dynamic languages, we find the associated contribution of a decentralized label model~\cite{363526} presciently appropriate for dealing with mashups in a web browser.

Vogt et al.~\cite{Vogt_CrossSiteScripting_2007} monitor the flow of sensitive information in the web browser by using dynamic data tainting.
Sensitive data is first marked at each source, and its use is dynamically tracked by the systems whenever it accessed by scripts running in the web browser.
By monitoring the data sinks, it is possible to detect when tainted data is about to be transferred to a third-party.

In recent research, Jang et al.~\cite{1866339} proposed an information flow framework for JavaScript based on source rewriting.
In contrast to our work, they introduce a ``rewrite function'' rather than new bytecodes.
This function is invoked on JavaScript code before it is delivered to the bytecode compiler.
Although rewriting the source can instrument policy enforcement mechanisms, their current implementation fails to detect implicit information flows.

Other source-rewriting work has been presented by Russo et al.~\cite{onthefly}.
This work inlines dynamic information flow monitors when a code string is evaluated.
They demonstrate that the dreaded \texttt{eval} statement can be secured to satisfy the non-interference property.
The inlining technique is advantageous in that it requires no modifications to the hosting environment.

Yu et al.~\cite{1190252} also present a rewriting approach that forces all untrusted JavaScript code to first pass through an instrumenting filter.
The resulting code then behaves in a controlled manner, which even allows for self-modification at runtime.

Dhawan et al.~\cite{1723250} present a system called Sabre (Security Architecture for Browser Extensions), which uses in-browser information flow tracking to analyze JavaScript based browser extensions.
They associate each in-memory JavaScript object with a label that determines whether the object contains sensitive information.
Sabre modifies this label whenever the responding object is modified and raises an alert if an object containing sensitive data is accessed in an unsafe way.

Russo et al.~\cite{1813092} propose a runtime enforcement mechanism for tracking information flow in DOM-like tree structures.
In their approach they monitor dynamic interactions where scripts can manipulate the DOM tree in order to transfer sensitive information.

ConScript, presented by Meyerovich et al.~\cite{5504806}, is a client-side advice implementation for enforcing JavaScript security.
Their work allows the author of the hosting page to express fine-grained application-specific security policies that will be enforced by the user's browser.
They also show how a policy can be automatically generated via static analysis of server-side code or runtime analysis of client-side code.

Crites et al.~\cite{1455784} have proposed ``OMash'', a mechanism which secures communication between scripts in a mashup.
Their approach does not rely on the SOP for determining whether access is granted on another page.
Instead, a webpage is treated as an object with a publicly declared interface, and communication between pages is restricted to be through this interface.

\section{Related and Future Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

%\todo{no standard benchmarks, no standard evals, no standard info flow attacks to compare against}

Over the past decades researchers have embraced the task of adding security enhancements to existing languages.
In this section, we show how our work fits into the field of information flow security and highlight related research which will likely bolster current efforts.
We remain optimistic that information flow can be brought from the world of static verification to the world of dynamically typed languages.

\subsection{Static Analysis}

In 1977, Denning and Denning~\cite{359712} gave a specification that ensures non-interference of Pascal programs using a static type checking analysis.
Programs which contain implicit information flows fail certification by the compiler.
This work builds on the lattice model~\cite{denning1976lattice} of secure information flow proposed in 1976.

In 2001, Myers and Liskov~\cite{myers2001jif} introduced a programming language called Jif (Java Information Flow), which extends Java with static checking of information flow.
Though the static analysis techniques developed in this work are not applicable to dynamic languages, we find the associated contribution of a decentralized label model~\cite{363526} presciently appropriate for dealing with the multitude of principals that require representation in an embedded language such as JavaScript.
%We have incorporated much of this model into our own work which allows a full, general tracking of which labels are involved in influencing each object.

Both of these works demonstrate static typing systems able to verify secure information flow.
We incorporate these insights into our labeling mechanism, adjusting as necessary for a dynamically typed language.
Our paper does not discuss many of these details in favor of keeping focus on the supporting data structures and implementation details.

\subsection{Other Approaches}

Other authors have implemented security mechanisms for JavaScript by employing source rewriting techniques.

In 2010, Russo et al.~\cite{1813092} provide a mechanism for tracking information flow within the Document Object Model, a browser provided API for manipulating page layout.
This work inlines dynamic information flow monitors at the time a code string evaluates.
They demonstrate that the dreaded \texttt{eval} statement can be secured enough to satisfy the termination-insensitive non-interference property.
The proposed technique prevents the DOM from being used as a covert channel.
In contrast, our work does not address information flows present within host provided objects.

Also in 2010, Jang et al.~\cite{1866339} proposed an information flow framework for JavaScript itself based on source rewriting.
Their framework invokes a rewrite function on JavaScript code and encapsulates it into a monitored closure.
Although rewriting the source can instrument policy enforcement mechanisms, their current implementation is not capable of detecting implicit information flows.
Although they give no performance numbers, we reason that these closures incur a high memory and function call overhead, something that we seek to prevent by operating at the instruction level.

\subsection{Security Stack}
\label{sec:relatedwork-security-stack}

We implement the control flow stack as a runtime shadow stack, which records the history of the labels attached to the program counter at each control flow branch.
The use of a runtime shadow stack is a common technique for securing programs~\cite{abadi2009control, frantzen2001stackghost, prasad2003binary} and has been successfully used in other information flow research~\cite{lam2006general}.
Our implementation extends this research by introducing \emph{explicit} instructions for manipulating the shadow stack.
After extensive literature review, we could not find any publications that introduce instructions for maintaining a runtime shadow stack data structure.
Indeed, we could find no authors which address these important details so vital to implementors.

In 2007, Vogt et al.~\cite{Vogt_CrossSiteScripting_2007} modified an earlier version of SpiderMonkey to monitor the flow of sensitive information in the Mozilla web browser by using dynamic data tainting.
Their system explicitly identified data sources and sinks within the Firefox browser, and tags data at each source.
For each script, a static data flow analysis simulates the VM operations on an \emph{abstract stack}, to determine existence of information leaks.
Their framework handles control structures such as \texttt{throw} and \texttt{try} conservatively, by statically marking all variables within that function as tainted.
Although the tainting mechanisms in this work closely parallel our own, we incorporate a \emph{runtime} stack that allows for a more precise analysis about implicit flows which \emph{actually} occur.

\subsection{Policy Specification}
\label{sec:policy_specification}

Although our implementation can trigger an alarm, complete with details about where and why an information flow violation occurred, we do not extend the Firefox browser with any mechanism for website authors to specify an information flow policy.

In 2007, Browser-Enforced Embedded Policy (BEEP)~\cite{beep} introduced the idea of allowing a webpage to specify which scripts are trusted, using the browser itself to filter out entire scripts.
Their framework hashes the source of each script and refers to a whitelist to determine the legitimacy of a script before executing it.
A website author must place this whitelist in the \texttt{<head>} portion of a webpage, so that the browser can load it before executing any JavaScript that might change the list.
Rather than focusing on whether a script itself is legitimate, we would rather preserve the flexibility of executing all scripts as long as they do not incur an information flow violation.

Introduced in 2010, ConScript~\cite{5504806} is a client-side advice implementation for enforcing JavaScript security that allows the author of a webpage to express fine-grained application-specific security policies that are enforced by the user's browser.
They show how a policy can be automatically generated via static analysis of server-side code or runtime analysis of client-side code.
Although they define a policy specification framework that can refer to the browser objects exported to JavaScript runtime, it is not capable of specifying a non-interference policy, so it cannot detect implicit information flows.

Although we achieve our objectives of implementing a framework that detects such violations without assistance from script authors,  we still feel that we will not be able to cut down on the number of false positives without some kind of author input.
The difficulty of introducing information flow security into large bodies of existing code without developer assistance has been a long standing problem in the field~\cite{1159651}.
Rather than address this issue in depth, we have focused our work on the implementation details of introducing information flow security into a mature VM.

\subsection{Formalization}

We currently do not have a formal proof that our framework can guarantee non-interference security.
Although some researchers have worked toward providing a formalization of JavaScript semantics~\cite{yu2007javascript, herman2007status, maffeis2008operational, guha2010essence} on which such a proof could be based, we did not find any that were readily suitable for creating such a proof.
These formalizations suffer from being incomplete with respect to all the features of JavaScript or are only available in paper form.
Tackling such a drawback will require much future work to bring these efforts into a state where they can be easily used by implementors as a verification framework within an automated proof system.
We eagerly await further research in this direction, so that we may identify and fix any bugs within our approach.
