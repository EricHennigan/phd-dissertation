\chapter{Label System Design Considerations}

Designing the labeling system supporting information flow tracking took special consideration.
FlowCore could have been written using one of two possible implementations of security types (Section~\ref{sec:implementation}): (1) extending of the tagged pointer representation and (2) introducing a security wrapper object.
Before choosing one implementation over the other, we first examine how each option affects the labeling of primitive values and interned objects and how the labeling mechanism will impact memory requirements and the garbage collector (Section~\ref{sec:analysis}).
We corroborate this analysis with a report on our experience during implementation (Section~\ref{sec:experience}).
Finally, I show how this work compares with that of others (Section~\ref{sec:related-work}), and finish with a recommendation that an extension of the tagged pointer representation meets the requirements of a dynamic information flow security type system and has the least implementation effort (Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}).

\section{Possible Implementations}
\label{sec:implementation}

Before discussing the details of the two possible implementations of dynamic security types, I first give a review of the existing dynamic type system that WebKit's JavaScriptCore VM employs.

\subsection{Existing Type System}

Many implementations of dynamically typed languages follow a common approach of using a tagged union to represent each possible primitive or object reference type~\cite{gudeman1993representing}.
In JavaScriptCore, this union takes the form of a 64-bit word, within the class \code{JSValue}.
Figure~\ref{fig:base-encoding} illustrates the union's fields as ordered on a big-endian\footnote{On a little-endian machine the order of the \code{tag} and \code{payload} fields are swapped.}, 64-bit machine.

Within a \code{JSValue}, a leading value of \texttt{0xFFFF} distinguishes 32-bit JavaScript integers.
Doubles are offset (under bitwise integer interpretation) by the value $2^{48}$ to ensure that all values have at least a leading value of \texttt{0x0001}.
JavaScriptCore maintains a garbage collected heap which stores JavaScript objects with 64-bit alignment.
Pointers to garbage collected JavaScript objects all begin with a leading \texttt{0x0000}, which nominally reduces the address space to 48 bits\footnote{Modern 64-bit processors only supply 48 bits of addressable space, so JavaScriptCore's chosen pointer encoding does not reduce the actual usable space.}.
The special JavaScript values \code{null}, \code{false}, \code{true}, and \code{undefined} each have bit 1 set, to distinguish them from properly aligned pointer values.
JavaScriptCore also encodes two additional values, again at invalid pointer addresses, which are not defined within the JavaScript language: \code{empty}, which represents array holes and uninitialized \code{JSValue}s, and \code{deleted}, which is used in hash table code.

\subsection{Fat Value Technique}\label{sec:fat-values}
We can achieve dynamic information flow security by attaching, onto each runtime value, additional bits which encode a pointer, handle, or taint value representing the security type.
We term this technique the \term{fat value} approach, and extend the existing \code{JSValue} representation with an additional 64-bit word to hold the security type.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fat-encoding}, each value within the interpreter then becomes 128-bits and contains both the originally encoded value and its security tag.

\end{figure}\hfill

The fat value technique requires modifying the core representation of all values within the VM.
While performing this modification on an arbitrary dynamic language VM is not necessarily a trivial undertaking, the designers of JavaScriptCore have conveniently encapsulation the type inspection and conversion methods in the \code{JSValue} class.
This practice makes the modification easier than on other JavaScript VM's such as SpiderMonkey.
However, appropriately tagging each value with a security label still requires manual inspection of all code sites which create new values.
Additionally, doubling the size of the core datatype also doubles the memory space requirements of any running program: the VM allocates twice as much space for the same number of core values.

\subsection{Security Wrapper Technique}\label{sec:cloaks}

Another mechanism, known as the security wrapper technique, can also achieve the goal of attaching a security label to each value.
In this mechanism, the VM labels JavaScript objects by extending them with an additional internal field.
We introduce an internal security wrapper object which stores a primitive together with its label.
Throughout our analysis, we shall refer to this wrapper object as a \term{cloak} and any value held within the wrapper as a \term{cloaked} value.
Figure~\ref{fig:security-wrapper} provides a visualization of the cloak mechanism.

\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.12]
    \node[anchor=center] at (12.5,2.5+2.5) {Object Reference};
    \node[anchor=center] at (12.5,2.5/2) {\tiny \texttt{0x0000 pppp pppp pppp}};
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (25,2.5);

    \coordinate (Obj) at (40,5);
    \node[anchor=center] at ($(Obj)+(15,2.5)$) {Cloak Object};
    \draw (Obj) rectangle ($(Obj)+(30,-15)$);
    \node[anchor=center] at ($(Obj)+(15,-2.5)$) {\vdots};
    \draw ($(Obj)-(0,5)$) -- ($(Obj)+(30,-5)$);
    \node[anchor=center] at ($(Obj)+(15,-5-2.5)$) {security label};
    \draw ($(Obj)-(0,10)$) -- ($(Obj)+(30,-10)$);
    \node[anchor=center] at ($(Obj)+(15,-10-2.5)$) {primitive value};

    \draw[-latex] (25,2.5/2) .. controls (25+15/2,2.5) and (25+15/2,5) ..  (Obj);

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Security wrapper scheme.}
\label{fig:security-wrapper}
\end{figure}

Internally, JavaScriptCore already supports wrapper classes for Strings and Dates, as well as automatic objection promotion for Numbers and Booleans.
Given this information, we might expect fewer modifications to be made to the underlying VM, as this change only requires the introduction of a new subclass of the existing \code{JSWrapperObject}.

However, implementing the wrapper class is not exactly trivial, even with the help of an existing framework.
From the perspective of the JavaScript program, a cloak object must mimic, in every circumstance, the same behavior as the primitive it cloaks.
Under no circumstances should the presence (or absence) of a security wrapper ever become evident to a JavaScript program, otherwise attacker provided code could exploit the difference in behavior.
%We make an exception to this guideline for policy violations, which have the side effect of halting the VM.
The wrapper must remain distinguishable to the VM, however, so that it can enforce information flow security.

Meeting this restriction is not presently possible using the existing wrapper framework.
The primary goals of the existing wrapper class is to collect those datatypes (Date, String, Number, and Boolean) which can be stored within the space of a \code{JSValue}.
As a result, the treatment of wrapped objects within the interpreter does not sufficiently take into account the behavioral differences between objects and primitives.
For example, in Listing~\ref{list:boolean}, a Boolean object wrapping the primitive value \code{false} behaves according to the rules governing objects rather than those of the primitive boolean value.
Consequently, the existing framework poses an imperfect fit for implementing information flow security, because it does not guarantee perfect transparency (from the perspective of a JavaScript program) when used to wrap primitives.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={JavaScript considers objects as `truthy' values.},label={list:boolean}]
js> var x = new Boolean(false)
js> if (x) { print("x is true"); }
x is true
\end{lstlisting}
