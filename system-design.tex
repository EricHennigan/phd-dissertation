\chapter{System Design Considerations}

Designing the labeling system supporting information flow tracking took special consideration.
Two possible implementations of security types (see Section~\ref{sec:implementation}): extending of the tagged pointer representation and introducing a security wrapper object.
We examine how each option affects the labeling of primitive values and interned objects, and how the labeling mechanism will impact memory requirements and the garbage collector (see Section~\ref{sec:analysis}).
We corroborate this analysis with a report on our experience during implementation (see Section~\ref{sec:experience}).
Finally, we discuss how our work compares with that of others (see Section~\ref{sec:related-work}), and finish with a recommendation that an extension of the tagged pointer representation meets the requirements of a dynamic information flow security type system and has the least implementation effort (see Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}).
