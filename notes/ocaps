The differences between ocap and IFlow

    demonstrate a revocation in IFLow
        verify with libiflow
    demonstrate (or prove failure) a reversal/cancellation of revocation

    discuss differences between ACL and IFlow and OCap

    IFlow: data _derived_ from the revocation is also revoked
    OCap:  entities _delegated_ from the cap are also revoked

    Confused Deputy:
        IFlow tags the data
        OCap 'tags' the caps
        is the importance emphasis to lie on the behavior of the deputy
                                       or on the abilities of the deputy
    
        the behavior is influenced by tagging the data
        the abilities are influenced by naming the caps

    What about end-to-end
         issues of naming, etc.
